# BrainFlix Back-End API #

## Project Overview ##

For this project, the focus is on building a fully functional API to manage video data. The team at "BrainFlix" trusts your abilities to develop this new API,
enhancing the scalability and performance of the application. The server-side code will be maintained in a new repository.

## Tools & Resources ##
* Mock API Documentation: Reference for building the new API.
* Postman: Used for testing the API.

## Functional Requirements ##

### API Server ###

* End-points and response structure match the mock API.
* End-points include GET /videos, GET /videos/:id, and POST /videos.
* Data persists on the server using a JSON file.
* Single JSON file serves as a source of truth for all data.
* Images served as static assets from the Node server.

### Video Upload Page ###

* Event handler for the upload form to post new videos to the API.
* New videos persisted in a JSON file on the server.
* Hardcoded image path used for the video thumbnail.

## Project Structure ##

* Develop and feature branches used for development.
* Merged develop branch with main before submitting.

This final sprint represents the completed BrainFlix project, incorporating feedback and delivering the requested features.
The project showcases proficiency in API development, React, and front-end design principles.
